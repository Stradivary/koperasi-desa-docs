# 4. Card Tamper Detection

## Security classification of validation failures

Each failure condition maps to a security event severity.

| Failure | Condition | Severity |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Magic / version mismatch | `magic` ≠ expected value or `version` unsupported | Medium — may be unformatted card |
| HMAC mismatch | Recomputed HMAC does not match trailer | **Critical** — active tamper |
| GCM decryption failure | AES-GCM tag check fails | **Critical** — active tamper |
| Counter rollback | On-card counter ≤ last known counter | **Critical** — replay or rollback attack |
| Timestamp rollback | `lastTimestamp` > `now + drift_allowance` | High — potential rollback |
| Balance inconsistency | Balance ≠ expected from log chain | **Critical** — active tamper |
| Log chain hash mismatch | Any chain hash fails recomputation | **Critical** — log tampering |
| Root hash mismatch | Trailer `rootHash` ≠ computed chain head | **Critical** — active tamper |
| Key version unknown | No grant available for the card's `keyVersion` | High — offline or re-key needed |
| Status blocked | `status` field is any `BLOCKED_*` value | Informational — expected state |

## Response policy

| Condition | Terminal action | Backend action |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| HMAC / GCM / chain / balance critical failure | Set `BLOCKED_TAMPER` on next authenticated write; if write not possible, report to backend immediately | Log tamper event; flag card; queue for operator review |
| Counter rollback | Refuse all operations; report to backend | Log replay event; flag for investigation |
| Timestamp rollback | Refuse write; log locally | Reconciliation flags event on upload |
| Key version unknown (online) | Request fresh session grant | Issue grant for current `keyVersion` |
| Key version unknown (offline) | Refuse write; display generic error | Receive report at next reconciliation |
| Blocked status | Allow read; refuse all writes | No action unless reconciliation detects escalation |

**Do not expose the specific failure reason to the end user.** Display `Card blocked` or `Card error — contact staff`. Detailed failure data belongs in operator and backend logs only.

## Tamper event log fields

Every tamper event submitted to the backend must include:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `tenantId` | Owning koperasi |
| `cardId` | Card identifier (hex) |
| `terminalId` | Reporting terminal |
| `accountId` | Operator on session at time of detection |
| `eventType` | One of: `tamper`, `replay`, `rollback`, `chain_break`, `balance_mismatch` |
| `detectedAt` | Terminal-local timestamp |
| `counter` | On-card counter value at time of detection |
| `failureStep` | Validation step number from Tech Specs §5 that failed |

Tamper events must be queued in the local outbox if the terminal is offline and submitted as part of the next reconciliation batch.

---

## Unverified-state rule

After any validation failure, the terminal must treat the card as **unverified**. The terminal must not:

- Display the balance as authoritative.
- Initiate any debit or credit.
- Update its local card snapshot.
- Allow a new session to proceed on that card without a full re-read and re-validation.

---

## Physical card security

- NTAG215/216 has no hardware-level write protection. The system must be **tamper-evident**, not tamper-proof.
- A tag with a countered password lock (NTAG215 `PWD_AUTH` / `AUTH0`) may optionally be used to slow down amateur modification but must not be relied upon as a security control.
- Cards that fail physical NFC read (I/O error, partial response) must be treated as unreadable and reported, not silently skipped.
